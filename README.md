# Number Classifier w/ React & Flask

This front-end, developed with React.js, complements a number classifier (0-9) system, with its back-end built on Flask (Python). The integration of Flask allows for seamless utilization of scikit-learn, enabling the creation of a predictive model. Users can draw numbers on the screen, and the system accurately predicts what number it is.

### Where is the back-end?
